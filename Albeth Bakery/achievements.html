            <p>The accomplishments of Albeth Bakery, according to co-owner Elena Malabag, go beyond just commercial success. Seeing both of her kids graduate from college a dream that the bakery helped realize is one of her finest achievements. Elena and her family were able to provide for their children's education by paying for tuition, school supplies, and other college-related costs using the money they made from Albeth Bakery</p>
